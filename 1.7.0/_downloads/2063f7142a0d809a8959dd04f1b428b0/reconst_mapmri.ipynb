        "\n# Continuous and analytical diffusion signal modelling with MAP-MRI\n\nWe show how to model the diffusion signal as a linear combination of continuous\nfunctions from the MAP-MRI basis [Ozarslan2013]_. This continuous representation\nallows for the computation of many properties of both the signal and diffusion\npropagator.\n\nWe show how to estimate the analytical orientation distribution function (ODF)\nand a variety of scalar indices. These include rotationally invariant quantities\nsuch as the mean squared displacement (MSD), Q-space inverse variance (QIV),\nteturn-to-origin probability (RTOP) and non-Gaussianity (NG). Interestingly, the\nMAP-MRI basis also allows for the computation of directional indices, such as\nthe return-to-axis probability (RTAP), the return-to-plane probability\n(RTPP), and the parallel and perpendicular non-Gaussianity.\n\nThe estimation of these properties from noisy and sparse DWIs requires that the\nfitting of the MAP-MRI basis is constrained and/or regularized. This can be done\nby constraining the diffusion propagator to positive values [Ozarslan2013]_\n[DelaHaije2020]_, and through analytic Laplacian regularization (MAPL)\n[Fick2016a]_.\n\nFirst import the necessary modules:\n"

        "The MAP-MRI Model can now be instantiated. The ``radial_order`` determines the\nexpansion order of the basis, i.e., how many basis functions are used to\napproximate the signal.\n\nFirst, we must decide to use the anisotropic or isotropic MAP-MRI basis. As was\nshown in [Fick2016a]_, the isotropic basis is best used for tractography\npurposes, as the anisotropic basis has a bias towards smaller crossing angles\nin the ODF. For signal fitting and estimation of scalar quantities the\nanisotropic basis is suggested. The choice can be made by setting\n``anisotropic_scaling=True`` or ``anisotropic_scaling=False``.\n\nFirst, we must select the method of regularization and/or constraining the\nbasis fitting.\n\n- ``laplacian_regularization=True`` makes it use Laplacian regularization\n  [Fick2016a]_. This method essentially reduces spurious oscillations in the\n  reconstruction by minimizing the Laplacian of the fitted signal. Several\n  options can be given to select the regularization weight:\n\n    - ``regularization_weighting=GCV`` uses generalized cross-validation\n      [Craven1978]_ to find an optimal weight.\n    - ``regularization_weighting=0.2`` for example would omit the GCV and\n      just set it to 0.2 (found to be reasonable in HCP data [Fick2016a]_).\n    - ``regularization_weighting=np.array(weights)`` would make the GCV use\n      a custom range to find an optimal weight.\n\n- ``positivity_constraint=True`` makes it use a positivity constraint on the\n  diffusion propagator. This method constrains the final solution of the\n  diffusion propagator to be positive either globally [DelaHaije2020] or at a\n  set of discrete points [Ozarslan2013]_, since negative values should not\n  exist.\n\n    - Setting ``global_constraints=True`` enforces positivity everywhere.\n      With the setting ``global_constraints=False`` positivity is enforced on\n      a grid determined by ``pos_grid`` and ``pos_radius``.\n\nBoth methods do a good job of producing viable solutions to the signal fitting\nin practice. The difference is that the Laplacian regularization imposes\nsmoothness over the entire signal, including the extrapolation beyond the\nmeasured signal. In practice this may result in, but does not guarantee,\npositive solutions of the diffusion propagator. The positivity constraint\nguarantees a positive solution which in general results in smooth solutions, but\ndoes not guarantee it.\n\nA suggested strategy is to use a low Laplacian weight together with a positivity\nconstraint. In this way both desired properties are guaranteed in final\nsolution. Higher Laplacian weights are recommended when the data is very noisy.\n\nWe use the package CVXPY (https://www.cvxpy.org/) to solve convex optimization\nproblems when ``positivity_constraint=True``, so we need to first install CVXPY.\nWhen using ``global_constraints=True`` to ensure global positivity, it is\nrecommended to use the MOSEK solver (https://www.mosek.com/) together with CVXPY\nby setting ``cvxpy_solver='MOSEK'``. Different solvers can differ greatly in\nterms of runtime and solution accuracy, and in some cases solvers may show\nwarnings about convergence or recommended option settings.\n\nFor now we will generate the anisotropic models for different combinations.\n\n"
