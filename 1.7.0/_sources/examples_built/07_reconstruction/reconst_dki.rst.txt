Reconstruction of the diffusion signal with the kurtosis tensor model
=====================================================================

The diffusion kurtosis model is an expansion of the diffusion tensor model
(see :ref:`example_reconst_dti`). In addition to the diffusion tensor (DT), the
diffusion kurtosis model quantifies the degree to which water diffusion in
biological tissues is non-Gaussian using the kurtosis tensor (KT)
[Jensen2005]_.

Measurements of non-Gaussian diffusion from the diffusion kurtosis model are of
interest because they can be used to characterize tissue microstructural
heterogeneity [Jensen2010]_. Moreover, DKI can be used to: 1) derive concrete
biophysical parameters, such as the density of axonal fibers and diffusion
tortuosity [Fierem2011]_ (see :ref:`example_reconst_dki_micro`); and 2)
resolve crossing fibers in tractography and to obtain invariant rotational
measures not limited to well-aligned fiber populations [NetoHe2015]_.

The diffusion kurtosis model expresses the diffusion-weighted signal as:

.. math::

    S(n,b)=S_{0}e^{-bD(n)+rac{1}{6}b^{2}D(n)^{2}K(n)}

where $\mathbf{b}$ is the applied diffusion weighting (which is dependent on
the measurement parameters), $S_0$ is the signal in the absence of diffusion
gradient sensitization, $\mathbf{D(n)}$ is the value of diffusion along
direction $\mathbf{n}$, and $\mathbf{K(n)}$ is the value of kurtosis along
direction $\mathbf{n}$. The directional diffusion $\mathbf{D(n)}$ and kurtosis
$\mathbf{K(n)}$ can be related to the diffusion tensor (DT) and kurtosis tensor
(KT) using the following equations:

.. math::
     D(n)=\sum_{i=1}^{3}\sum_{j=1}^{3}n_{i}n_{j}D_{ij}

and

.. math::
     K(n)=rac{MD^{2}}{D(n)^{2}}\sum_{i=1}^{3}\sum_{j=1}^{3}\sum_{k=1}^{3}
     \sum_{l=1}^{3}n_{i}n_{j}n_{k}n_{l}W_{ijkl}

where $D_{ij}$ are the elements of the second-order DT, and $W_{ijkl}$ the
elements of the fourth-order KT and $MD$ is the mean diffusivity. As the DT,
KT has antipodal symmetry and thus only 15 Wijkl elements are needed to fully
characterize the KT:

.. math::
   egin{matrix} ( & W_{xxxx} & W_{yyyy} & W_{zzzz} & W_{xxxy} & W_{xxxz}
                    & ... \
                    & W_{xyyy} & W_{yyyz} & W_{xzzz} & W_{yzzz} & W_{xxyy}
                    & ... \
                    & W_{xxzz} & W_{yyzz} & W_{xxyz} & W_{xyyz} & W_{xyzz}
                    & & )\end{matrix}

In the following example we show how to fit the diffusion kurtosis model on
diffusion-weighted multi-shell datasets and how to estimate diffusion kurtosis
based statistics.

First, we import all relevant modules:

DKI requires multi-shell data, i.e. data acquired from more than one non-zero
b-value. Here, we use fetch to download a multi-shell dataset which was kindly
provided by Hansen and Jespersen (more details about the data are provided in
their paper [Hansen2016]_). The total size of the downloaded data is 192
MBytes, however you only need to fetch it once.

Function ``get_fnames`` downloads and outputs the paths of the data,
``load_nifti`` returns the data as a nibabel Nifti1Image object, and
``read_bvals_bvecs`` loads the arrays containing the information about the
b-values and b-vectors. These later arrays are converted to the GradientTable
object required for Dipy_'s data reconstruction.

Before fitting the data, we perform some data pre-processing. We first compute
a brain mask to avoid unnecessary calculations on the background of the image.

Since the diffusion kurtosis models involves the estimation of a large number
of parameters [TaxCMW2015]_ and since the non-Gaussian components of the
diffusion signal are more sensitive to artefacts [NetoHe2012]_, it might be
favorable to suppress the effects of noise and artefacts before diffusion
kurtosis fitting. In this example the effects of noise and artefacts are
suppress by using 3D Gaussian smoothing (with a Gaussian kernel with
fwhm=1.25) as suggested by pioneer DKI studies (e.g. [Jensen2005]_,
[NetoHe2012]_). Although here the Gaussian smoothing is used so that results
are comparable to these studies, it is important to note that more advanced
noise and artifact suppression algorithms are available in DIPY_, e.g. the
Marcenko-Pastur PCA denoising algorithm (:ref:`example-denoise-mppca`) and
the Gibbs artefact suppression algorithm (:ref:`example-denoise-gibbs`).

    for v in range(data.shape[-1]):

Now that we have loaded and pre-processed the data we can go forward
with DKI fitting. For this, the DKI model is first defined for the data's
GradientTable object by instantiating the DiffusionKurtosisModel object in the
following way:

To fit the data using the defined model object, we call the ``fit`` function of
this object. For the purpose of this example, we will only fit a single slice of
the data:

The fit method creates a DiffusionKurtosisFit object, which contains all the
diffusion and kurtosis fitting parameters and other DKI attributes. For
instance, since the diffusion kurtosis model estimates the diffusion tensor,
all standard diffusion tensor statistics can be computed from the
DiffusionKurtosisFit instance. For example, we can extract the fractional
anisotropy (FA), the mean diffusivity (MD), the axial diffusivity (AD) and the
radial diffusivity (RD) from the DiffusionKurtosisiFit instance. Of course,
these measures can also be computed from DIPY's ``TensorModel`` fit, and should
be analogous; however, theoretically, the diffusion statistics from the kurtosis
model are expected to have better accuracy, since DKI's diffusion tensor are
decoupled from higher order terms effects [Veraar2011]_, [NetoHe2012]_. Below we
compare the FA, MD, AD, and RD, computed from both DTI and DKI.

   Diffusion tensor measures obtained from the diffusion tensor estimated
   from DKI (upper panels) and DTI (lower panels).

DTI's diffusion estimates present lower values than DKI's estimates,
showing that DTI's diffusion measurements are underestimated  by higher order
effects.

In addition to the standard diffusion statistics, the DiffusionKurtosisFit
instance can be used to estimate the non-Gaussian measures of mean kurtosis
(MK), the axial kurtosis (AK) and the radial kurtosis (RK).

   DKI standard kurtosis measures.

The non-Gaussian behaviour of the diffusion signal is expected to be higher
when tissue water is confined by multiple compartments. MK is, therefore,
higher in white matter since it is highly compartmentalized by myelin sheaths.
These water diffusion compartmentalization is expected to be more pronounced
perpendicularly to white matter fibers and thus the RK map presents higher
amplitudes than the AK map.

It is important to note that kurtosis estimates might present negative estimates
in deep white matter regions (e.g. the band of dark voxels in the RK map above).
These negative kurtosis values are artefactual and might be induced by:
1) low radial diffusivities of aligned white matter - since it is very hard
to capture non-Gaussian information in radial direction due to it's low
diffusion decays, radial kurtosis estimates (and consequently the mean
kurtosis estimates) might have low robustness and tendency to exhibit negative
values [NetoHe2012]_;
2) Gibbs artefacts - MRI images might be corrupted by signal oscillation
artefact between tissue's edges if an inadequate number of high frequencies of
the k-space is sampled. These oscillations might have different signs on
images acquired with different diffusion-weighted and inducing negative biases
in kurtosis parametric maps [Perron2015]_, [NetoHe2018]_.

One can try to suppress this issue by using the more advance noise and artefact
suppression algorithms, e.g., as mentioned above, the MP-PCA denoising
(:ref:`example-denoise-mppca`) and Gibbs Unringing
(:ref:`example-denoise-gibbs`) algorithms. Alternatively, one can overcome this
artefact by computing the kurtosis values from powder-averaged
diffusion-weighted signals. The details on how to compute the kurtosis from
powder-average signals in dipy are described in follow the tutorial
(:ref:`example-reconst-msdki`). Finally, one can use constrained optimization to
ensure that the fitted parameters are physically plausible [DelaHa2020]_, as we
will illustrate in the next section. Ideally though, artefacts such as Gibbs
ringing should be corrected for as well as possible before using constrained
optimization.

Constrained optimization for DKI
================================

When instantiating the DiffusionKurtosisModel, the model can be set up to use
constraints with the option `fit_method='CLS'` (for ordinary least squares) or
with `fit_method='CWLS'` (for weighted least squares). Constrained fitting takes
more time than unconstrained fitting, but is generally recommended to prevent
physically unplausible parameter estimates [DelaHa2020]_. For performance
purposes it is recommended to use the MOSEK solver (https://www.mosek.com/) by
setting ``cvxpy_solver='MOSEK'``. Different solvers can differ greatly in terms
of runtime and solution accuracy, and in some cases solvers may show warnings
about convergence or recommended option settings.

.. note::
   In certain atypical scenarios, the DKI+ constraints could potentially be

   unconstrained counterpart to verify that there are no unexpected
   qualitative differences.

We can now compare the kurtosis measures obtained with the constrained fit to
the measures obtained before, where we see that many of the artefactual voxels
have now been corrected. In particular outliers caused by pure noise -- instead
of for example acquisition artefacts -- can be corrected with this method.

Mean kurtosis tensor and kurtosis fractional anisotropy
=======================================================

As pointed by previous studies [Hansen2013]_, axial, radial and mean kurtosis
depends on the information of both diffusion and kurtosis tensor. DKI measures
that only depend on the kurtosis tensor include the mean of the kurtosis tensor
[Hansen2013]_, and the kurtosis fractional anisotropy [GlennR2015]_. These
measures are computed and illustrated below:

   DKI measures obtained from the kurtosis tensor only.

As reported by [Hansen2013]_, the mean of the kurtosis tensor (MKT) produces
similar maps than the standard mean kurtosis (MK). On the other hand,
the kurtosis fractional anisotropy (KFA) maps shows that the kurtosis tensor
have different degrees of anisotropy than the FA measures from the diffusion
tensor.
