Reconstruction with Constrained Spherical Deconvolution
=======================================================

This example shows how to use Constrained Spherical Deconvolution (CSD)
introduced by Tournier et al. [Tournier2007]_.

This method is mainly useful with datasets with gradient directions acquired on
a spherical grid.

The basic idea with this method is that if we could estimate the response
function of a single fiber then we could deconvolve the measured signal and
obtain the underlying fiber distribution.

In this way, the reconstruction of the fiber orientation distribution function
(fODF) in CSD involves two steps:
    1. Estimation of the fiber response function
    2. Use the response function to reconstruct the fODF

Let's first load the data. We will use a dataset with 10 b0s and 150 non-b0s
with b-value 2000.

    from dipy.io.image import load_nifti

    hardi_fname, hardi_bval_fname, hardi_bvec_fname = get_fnames('stanford_hardi')

    data, affine = load_nifti(hardi_fname)

    bvals, bvecs = read_bvals_bvecs(hardi_bval_fname, hardi_bvec_fname)
    gtab = gradient_table(bvals, bvecs)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 43-61

You can verify the b-values of the dataset by looking at the attribute
``gtab.bvals``. Now that a dataset with multiple gradient directions is
loaded, we can proceed with the two steps of CSD.

Step 1. Estimation of the fiber response function
=================================================

There are many strategies to estimate the fiber response function. Here two
different strategies are presented.

**Strategy 1 - response function estimates from a local brain region**
One simple way to estimate the fiber response function is to look for regions
of the brain where it is known that there are single coherent fiber
populations. For example, if we use a ROI at the center of the brain, we will
find single fibers from the corpus callosum. The ``auto_response_ssst``
function will calculate FA for a cuboid ROI of radii equal to ``roi_radii`` in
the center of the volume and return the response function estimated in that
region for the voxels with FA higher than 0.7.

.. code-block:: default



    from dipy.reconst.csdeconv import (auto_response_ssst,
                                       mask_for_response_ssst,
                                       response_from_mask_ssst)

    response, ratio = auto_response_ssst(gtab, data, roi_radii=10, fa_thr=0.7)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 70-78

Note that the ``auto_response_ssst`` function calls two functions that can be
used separately. First, the function ``mask_for_response_ssst`` creates a mask
of voxels within the cuboid ROI that meet the FA threshold constraint. This
mask can be used to calculate the number of voxels that were kept, or to also
apply an external mask (a WM mask for example). Second, the function
``response_from_mask_ssst`` takes the mask and returns the response function
calculated within the mask. If no changes are made to the mask between the two
calls, the resulting responses should be identical.

    mask = mask_for_response_ssst(gtab, data, roi_radii=10, fa_thr=0.7)

The ``response`` tuple contains two elements. The first is an array with
the eigenvalues of the response function and the second is the average S0 for
this response.

It is good practice to always validate the result of auto_response_ssst. For
this purpose we can print the elements of ``response`` and have a look at their
values.

The tensor generated from the response must be prolate (two smaller eigenvalues
should be equal) and look anisotropic with a ratio of second to first
eigenvalue of about 0.2. Or in other words, the axial diffusivity of this
tensor should be around 5 times larger than the radial diffusivity.

We can double-check that we have a good response function by visualizing the
response function's ODF. Here is how you would do that:

**Strategy 2 - data-driven calibration of response function** Depending
on the dataset, FA threshold may not be the best way to find the best possible
response function. For one, it depends on the diffusion tensor
(FA and first eigenvector), which has lower accuracy at high
b-values. Alternatively, the response function can be calibrated in a
data-driven manner [Tax2014]_.

First, the data is deconvolved with a 'fat' response function. All voxels that
are considered to contain only one peak in this deconvolution (as determined by
the peak threshold which gives an upper limit of the ratio of the second peak
to the first peak) are maintained, and from these voxels a new response
function is determined. This process is repeated until convergence is
reached. Here we calibrate the response function on a small part of the data.
